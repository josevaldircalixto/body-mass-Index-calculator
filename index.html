    What your BMI result means

    A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a
    healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on,
    such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced
    fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally,
    strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for
    five days a week.

  <ul>
    <li>Healthy eating
      Healthy eating promotes weight control, disease prevention, better digestion,
      immunity, mental clarity, and mood.
    </li>

    <li>Regular exercise
      Exercise improves fitness, aids weight control, elevates mood, and reduces disease
      risk, fostering wellness and longevity.</li>

    <li>Adequate sleep
      Sleep enhances mental clarity, emotional stability, and physical wellness, promoting
      overall restoration and rejuvenation.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Limitations of BMI</h2>

    <p>Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for
      every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in
      certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Gender
        The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age. Consequently,
        a child's age and gender are considered when evaluating their BMI.</li>

      <li>Age
        In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI to underestimate
        body fat content.</li>

      <li>Muscle
        BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese, as it doesn't
        differentiate muscle from fat.</li>

      <li>Pregnancy
        Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing baby. Maintaining a
        healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to minimise health risks for both mother
        and child.</li>

      <li>Race
        Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some Black and Asian origins at
        lower BMIs than others. To learn more, it is advised to discuss this with your
        GP or practice nurse.</li>
